Create a movie library web application with the below features using any tech stack of your choice -

1. The application must have user authentication ( Sign In/ Sign Up )
2. After logging in users will be navigated to the home screen where they should see a search
   option where they can search movies and see details of those movies.
3. They can create a list of movies by adding the movies to lists. ( Similar to youtube playlists ).
   On the home page, different movie lists created by that user will be displayed.
4. These lists can be either public ( anyone with a link to the list can see this ) or private ( only
   the person who created can see this list )
5. You can use OMDB API for the movie search option.
6. The Search & List page should have a nice layout, taking inspiration from other
   websites/applications.
7. Include Steps to run ( Readme file ) in the project as well.
8. You must host their projects online and provide working links of the application as well as
   code. ( e.g. Netlify, Vercel, Heroku, JSBin etc. )# movie-lab
